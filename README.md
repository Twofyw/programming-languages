# programming-languages
I'm currently learning the Programming Languages series courses at Coursera

Course Goals

Successful course participants will:

Internalize an accurate understanding of what functional and object-oriented programs mean
Develop the skills necessary to learn new programming languages quickly
Master specific language concepts such that they can recognize them in strange guises
Learn to evaluate the power and elegance of programming languages and their constructs
Attain reasonable proficiency in the ML, Racket, and Ruby languages --- and, as a by-product, become more proficient in languages they already know
